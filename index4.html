<p>The key is A flat minor.</p>
<p>The tempo is 135 bpm.</p>
<p>The context is that it's about hiding your emotions and the effect that has. That's why I think it's called "Clear".</p>
<p>Key lyrics are: "I wish that I had two faces. To prove which theory works. Yelling on the street corner. Or cleverly masking your words."</p>
