<p>The key is E flat major.</p>
<p>The tempo is 170 bpm.</p>
<p>The context is that it's about finding hope. To get through negative situations. There are happy and sad parts to the song. Taken together, it's about how to get through difficult times.</p>
<p>Key lyrics are: "But I'll kindly enter into rooms of depression. While ceiling fans and idle hands will take my life again." and "Redemption's not that far. And darkness is going down."</p>
